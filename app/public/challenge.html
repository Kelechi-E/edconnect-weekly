<h1>Ehighibe Kelechi</h1>

<p>Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.</p>
<ol> 
    <li>I love to start numbering from zero instead of one</li> 
    <li>I love to take photographs wherever I go</li>
    <li>I love harmony</li>
  <li>I can eat same food, day-in-day-out and not get bored</li>
  <li>I can listen to same song non-stop in loop for days and still enjoy it. This freaks out all my buddies :)</li>
</ol>
